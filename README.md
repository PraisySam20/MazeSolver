# Maze Solver
***INTRODUCTION***
<br>
Maze solving is a classic problem in computer science and artificial intelligence that involves navigating through a complex labyrinth from a designated starting point to a specified destination. The maze itself is often represented as a grid of cells, where each cell can either be a passageway or an obstacle, such as a wall. The objective is to discover a viable path through the maze, considering the constraints imposed by the maze's structure.

***ALGORITHM USED***
<br>
The algorithm used in this code is Depth-First Search (DFS). It recursively explores each possible path from the starting point 'S' to the goal 'G' in the maze by moving in all four directionsâ€”up, down, left, and right. If it encounters a wall or a visited cell, it backtracks and tries an alternate route. This backtracking approach ensures that all potential paths are explored until the goal is reached or no solution exists. DFS is well-suited for maze-solving as it allows deep exploration of paths and easy implementation through recursion.
